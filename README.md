# The_Sparks_foundation-TASK1
This was an internship task which I completed during my one month internship with The Sparks Foundation.
In this task, we had a dataset containing student data, numver of hours they study daily and what percentage they score.
Using Linear Regression, a model was built which takes number of hours as input and predict expected percentage.
